## Our Project Layout
## Welcome to our Customized Fitness Plan Creation Program
For our passion project, we've chosen to develop a program that can support you in your pursuit of attaining your desired body shape. This program is designed to aid you in either gaining or losing weight, helping you work towards your ideal physique while promoting a healthier lifestyle

## How Our Program Works

To begin, you'll determine your daily calorie maintenance by providing details such as your age, weight, height, gender, and activity level. This information will be securely stored in our backend associated with your user profile. Subsequently, we'll utilize this data to formulate a personalized plan aligned with your objectives and dietary preferences. If your goal is weight loss, we'll recommend a combination of cardio-focused exercises and suitable foods to assist you in reaching your fitness targets.
