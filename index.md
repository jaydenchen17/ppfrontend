## Welcome to our Customized Fitness Plan Creation Program
For our passion project we decided to create a program that will help you on your way to achieve your dream physique. This prpgram can help you on your journey to gain or lose weight and obtain your dream physique, promoting a healthier lifestyle. 

# How Our Program Works

- Plans, Lists, [Scrum Boards](https://clickup.com/blog/scrum-board/) help you to track key events, show progress and record time.  Effort is a big part of your class grade.  Show plans and time spent!
- [Hacks(Todo)](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/six-ultimate-daily-hacks-for-every-programmer-60f5f10feae) enable you to stay in focus with key requirements of the class.  Each Hack will produce Tangibles.
- Tangibles or [Tangible Artifacts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifact_(software_development)) are things you accumulate as a learner and coder. 

First we will have you calculate your daily calorie maintenence about, by inputting your age, weight, height, gender, and activity level. We will store this information with your user in our backend. Then we will use this information to create a plan based on your goals and your diet. If you want to lose weight we will suggest foods and excersizes thats more cardio based to help you acheive your fitness goals.
